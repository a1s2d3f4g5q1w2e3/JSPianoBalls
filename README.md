#  Piano Balls
#### Video Demo: [https://youtu.be/rI64rVufr6k](https://youtu.be/a5TyWyW3zEw)
#### Description:
A simple "game" that creates a virtual environment of "infinite bounce" balls, with a floor that represents the keys of the piano.
The game is currently under occasional development.
The balls can be positioned by pressing keys 1 through 9 and placed inside the game window using a mouse.
Balls can be "selected" by pressing the number representing the ball, causing it to turn red.
The ball can then be pushed to either side or brought higher or lower using the arrow keys.
The contact with the piano "floor" is captured into a CSV file that can be turned into a MIDI file if desired.
